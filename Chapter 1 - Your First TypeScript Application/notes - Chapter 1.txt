Starting a typescript program:

-create a todo folder
-cd into todo

-create a tsconfig.json file with the following:
{
    "compilerOptions": 
    {
    "target": "es2018",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "module": "commonjs"
    }
}

-create a dist and src folder

-create ts files in src

-when ready to compile navigate to the todo folder
>and enter tsc

the compiled javascript will be located in the dist folder

--------------------------------------------------------------

Do not make changes to the js files in dist as they will be 
overwritten by compiled ts code.

--

The first program will be a todo list.

--

Classes are templates that describe a data type.

--

Javascript supports classes with constructors, properties, and methods,
but features such as access control keywords like public are supplied by
TypeScript.

--

The headline TypeScript feature is static typing, which allows the type of each 
property and parameter in the TodoItem class to be specified.

public id: number;

--

public id: number;
Is an example of a type annotation.
This tells the TypeScript compiler that id is of type number.
