npm install --save-dev typescript@3.5.1

The --save-dev argument tells NPM that these are packages for use in development 
but not part of the application. @ symbol, followed by the version that is required.

First, a tsconfig.json configuration file must be made for the Typescript compiler.

{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "es2018",
"outDir": "./dist",
"rootDir": "./src"
}
}
configuration file is used to override the default settings 
and ensures a consistent configuration is always used

make a folder "dist" and "src"
src is where typescript goes
dist is where compiled js is put
-------------------------------
>tsc
compiles the code
-------------------------------
tsc-watch This package watches a source code folder, runs the TypeScript 
compiler when there is a change, and executes the compiled JavaScript code.
-------------------------------
tsc --listFiles
to see the files that are selected by the compiler configuration.
The files displayed by the listFiles option include the type 
declarations that the compiler has located.
-------------------------------
Do not edit JS in the dist folder as it will be overwritten when compiled again.
-------------------------------
By default, the compiler continues to emit JavaScript code even when it encounters
an error.
To disable this, add the following to tsconfig.json:
{
"compilerOptions": {
"target": "es2018",
"outDir": "./dist",
"rootDir": "./src",
"noEmitOnError": true
}
}
When the compiler runs, output will be generated only when there are no errors detected in the
JavaScript code.
-------------------------------
Enabling watch mode to automatically compile.
tsc --watch

If you see a Check failed: U_SUCCESS(status) error,
then may need to update to the latest version of Node.js
-------------------------------
Automatically Executing Code After Compilation

npx tsc-watch --onsuccess "node dist/index.js"
-------------------------------
Starting the Compiler Using NPM

add to package.json:
"scripts": {
"start": "tsc-watch --onsuccess \"node dist/index.js\""
},
Care must be taken to escape the quote characters required for the onsuccess argument
-------------------------------
Using the Version Targeting Feature

TypeScript relies on the most recent versions of the JavaScript language
recent features can be used during development to
create code that can be executed by older JavaScript runtimes, such as legacy browsers
