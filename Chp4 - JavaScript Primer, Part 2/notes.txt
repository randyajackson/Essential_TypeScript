Understanding JavaScript Object Inheritance

JavaScript objects have a link to another object, known as the prototype, from which they inherit properties
and methods.

Object provides some basic features that all objects
inherit, including a method named toString.

hat -----------inherits from ----------------> object

Object is the prototype for most objects, but it also provides some methods that are used directly, rather
than through inheritance, and which can be used to get information about prototypes.

getPrototypeOf This method returns an object’s prototype.
setPrototypeOf This method changes the prototype of an object.
getOwnPropertyNames This method returns the names of an object’s own properties

hat -----------inherits from ----------------> object
boots -----------inherits from ----------------> object

Prototypes are regular JavaScript objects
new properties can be defined on prototypes
new values can be assigned to existing properties

let hatPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(hat);
hatPrototype.toString = function() {
    return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;
   }

changes the toString method of both hat and boots

-------------------------------------
Creating custom prototypes

Changes to Object should be made cautiously
They affect all the other objects in the application.

A better approach is to crerate a prototype specifically for those objects that are known to 
have name and price properties.

Which can be done using the Object.setPrototypeOf method.

let ProductProto = {
    toString: function() {
    return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;
    }
   }

Object.setPrototypeOf(hat, ProductProto);
Object.setPrototypeOf(boots, ProductProto);

hats & boots ---- [inherits from] ---> ProductProto --- [inherits from] ----> Object

Prototypes are defined like any other object.
This creates a chain of prototypes that you can use.

----------------------------------------
Using constructor functions

A constructor function:
-creates a new object
-configures its properties
-assigns its prototype
