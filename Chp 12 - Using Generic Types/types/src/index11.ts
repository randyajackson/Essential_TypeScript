// SearchableCollection<T> class in Listing 12-16 used the instanceof keyword to identify Employee

// For classes with type parameters that are not restricted,
// narrowing to a specific type can be difficult

// the filter methodâ€™s generic type parameter, named V, is defined with the extend keyword,

// type T, which prevents the compiler from treating V as any

// value here.

// TypeScript code during the compilation process
// which means that there is no information available at
// runtime to use generic types with the instanceof keyword.
